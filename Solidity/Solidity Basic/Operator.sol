    Solidity Operators
    Solidity supports a variety of operators to perform arithmetic, logical, comparison, and bitwise operations.
    Here's a list of the common operators:

Arithmetic Operators
    Addition: +
    Subtraction: -
    Multiplication: *
    Division: /
    Modulo: %
Comparison Operators
    Equal to: ==
    Not equal to: !=
    Greater than: >
    Less than: <   
    Greater than or equal to: >=
    Less than or equal to: <=
Logical Operators
    Logical AND: &&
    Logical OR: ||
    Logical NOT: !
Bitwise Operators
    Bitwise AND: &
    Bitwise OR: |
    Bitwise XOR: ^
    Bitwise NOT: ~
    Left shift: <<   
    Right shift: >>
Assignment Operators
    Simple assignment: =
    Addition assignment: +=
    Subtraction assignment: -=
    Multiplication assignment: *=
    Division assignment: /=   
    Modulo assignment: %=   
    Bitwise AND assignment: &=
    Bitwise OR assignment: |=
    Bitwise XOR assignment: ^=
    Left shift assignment: <<=
    Right shift assignment: >>=
